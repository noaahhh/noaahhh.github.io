I will talk about the systemd package on Linux systems, which will be used in the application development process or for custom.\nFirst of all, systemd is a software package included in linux operating systems, according to Lennart Poettering… He is the author of the package software.\nIt is created by the init process and takes 1 as the process id (pid). systemd services are started automatically and can be managed by root users. With the sytemctl command, systemd services can be started (start) and stopped (stop), applications that have changed configuration files can be re-read and restarted (reload), the status of the process can be obtained (status), and its activation can be controlled after the system restarts ( enable/disable). For more information, see the manual page.\n$ man systemctl Flask microframework is a very easy-to-use framework software for creating simple APIs. To add it to your script file, it is sufficient to download the flask module with pip3 and include it on the page, and create an app object to create your routes. Then the script below can be used.\nimport flask app = flask.Flask(__name__) app.config[\u0026#34;DEBUG\u0026#34;] = True @app.route(\u0026#39;/\u0026#39;, methods=[\u0026#39;GET\u0026#39;]) def function_one(): return \u0026#34;\u0026lt;div style=\\\u0026#34;display: flex;justify-content: center;align-items: center;height: 100%;border: 3px solid green; \\\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hello sir, It seems to work properly.Here is\u0026lt;span style=\\\u0026#34;font-size:50px; color:white; background-color:red\\\u0026#34;\u0026gt; / \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026#34; @app.route(\u0026#39;/users\u0026#39;, methods=[\u0026#39;GET\u0026#39;]) def function_two(): return \u0026#34;\u0026lt;div style=\\\u0026#34;display: flex;justify-content: center;align-items: center;height: 100%;border: 3px solid green; \\\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hello sir, It seems to work properly.Here is\u0026lt;span style=\\\u0026#34;font-size:50px; color:white; background-color:green\\\u0026#34;\u0026gt; /users\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026#34; @app.route(\u0026#39;/products\u0026#39;, methods=[\u0026#39;GET\u0026#39;]) def function_three(): return \u0026#34;\u0026lt;div style=\\\u0026#34;display: flex;justify-content: center;align-items: center;height: 100%;border: 3px solid green; \\\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hello sir, It seems to work properly.Here is\u0026lt;span style=\\\u0026#34;font-size:50px; color:white; background-color:blue\\\u0026#34;\u0026gt; /products \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026#34; app.run() By default, it starts working on the localhost:5000 port. To change port or host, you can give new host and port with app.run(host='ip_addr',port='port' ).\nAfter the script is saved as app.py, it can be converted to a systemd service by writing the systemd service.\nWhen a flask application is run with python, it is raised on the \u0026ldquo;development server\u0026rdquo;. There are different options for the API to be raised in the \u0026ldquo;Production\u0026rdquo; environment. You can learn from the Flask manual page.\nCheck it out flask Deployment options\nDepending on the operating system, sudo vi /lib/systemd/system/myFlaskApp.service or Let\u0026rsquo;s open it in nano editor. This path may differ depending on the distro. To find out where other services are, e.g. for mariadb service,\n$ locate mariadb If there is no output, use the updatedb command and try again. services can also be found under /usr/lib/systemd/system/… Or you can create such a directory under the /usr directory.\n/lib/systemd/system/myFlaskApp.service =\u0026gt;\n[Unit] Description=My flask API service [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target [Service] Type=simple User=your username PermissionsStartOnly=true ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /your/path/app.py Restart=on-failure TimeoutSec=600 Note: Here we set Restart=on-failure. This indicates that we only want it to restart when the exit code is not 0. We can also add Restart=always and RestartSec=1 lines instead. It makes it reboot in any case. You can add a config file with sudo vi /etc/init/myFlaskApp.config.\ndescription \u0026#34;MyFlaskApp\u0026#34; start on stopped rc RUNLEVEL=[2345] respawn exec python3 /your/path/app.py Then,\n$ sudo systemctl start myFlaskApp You can start the service with this command.

It takes a pid as can be seen with sytemctl status. If a modular API structure is created and the route operation and other operations are isolated from each other, this method may be useful in situations where no modifications to this file are required.

For this, I plan to prepare two different websites and use different third-party web services that will be useful to us while preparing them. First of all, I will talk about the use of hugo and then I will continue by creating a simple website.\nHugo Hugo is a static web-site generator written in Go. This framework can quickly create a static website with terminal commands, thanks to a freely installed and available CLI tool. It also has different deployment options. In the hosting and deployment section of the gohugo.io site, it is explained how the website can be hosted on different web hosting platforms. But in this article, I will build a website that will be hosted on github and run in the domain username.github.io.\nTo download the framework and for a quick start, you can go to gohugo.io to install it on your system and start right away. If you are using a GNU distribution, the package is probably in your repository. On ubuntu and debian repositories hugo can be installed with;\n$ sudo apt install hugo On Fedora repositories hugo can be installed with;\n$ sudo dnf install hugo In hugo official website, it recommends installation with homebrew for both linux and mac. You can use the code below for Homebrew installation;\n$ /bin/bash -c \u0026#34;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\u0026#34; Then you can install hugo on your system with brew install hugo\nAfter the installation, You can create a new web site with\n$ hugo new site /path/to/your/site on terminal.The file hierarchy is as follows. The config.toml file is the file that allows us to configure the website. Now, this will open a blank page. Because there is no file in the layout. You can clone one or more themes by selecting them from gohugo.io/themes and using git into the themes directory. using hugo new content/new_article.md it can be used to create a new content.\nThe website will start working on local server 1331 port with\n$ hugo server If you want to take your experience further, you can create your own design by using the template tutorial on gohugo.io. But in this article, I will only create web pages using ready-made templates.\nCreating a Static Portfolio Page Portfolio pages are one of the best examples of static pages. These are the types of pages where the works done are exhibited and other accounts or communication e-mails are given as links. To create it, I first need to clone it with git by selecting from the portfolio themes listed on the themes.gohugo.io page. I choose the theme named hugo-shell-theme. One of the reasons why I prefer it is that it has a very simple structure. I will make my first attempt using this theme. I\u0026rsquo;m clonnig the theme into themes directory with\n$ git init $ git submodule add https://github.com/Yukuro/hugo-theme-shell.git themes/hugo-theme-shell $ hugo server -t hugo-theme-shell -w -D and starting the hugo server.It is currently running on the local server, but without any configuration. for this, I copy the content of the config.toml given on the github page of the theme and paste it into my config file in the directory. Below is the config file where I changed some parts and deleted the comment lines. I preferred powershell as shema. It gives me an output like this: For a better use, you can try to use a markdown file in the description. For example, you can find the portfolio website I use at noaahhh.github.io.\nFor Markdown usage, a description.md created in content is given to the description section of the config file.\ndescription=/description.md Then you can fill out whatever you want. If you go to the code side, you can see how it takes the parameters from the config file between the html tags.\nLikewise, now I\u0026rsquo;m cloning the hugo-profile theme into the themes directory with git. This theme uses config.yml with .yaml extension as config file. I copy one of the 3 different yaml files (v1.yml) in the theme directory to my root directory as config.yml. And content of the website directory must be copied root directory. Our website is using the new theme on the local server after the command below.\n$ hugo server -t hugo-profile -w -D --config=config.yaml In this theme, you can also create your personal website by changing the parameters in the config file. In the following sections, I will talk about a more user-experience-oriented method.\ne-commerce and product presentation pages In this section I will try the Hero theme. Hero has a familiar type of company landing page and a clean interface. That\u0026rsquo;s why I chose this theme. I\u0026rsquo;m creating a new website with Hugo. Then I clone this theme with git into the theme directory. There is a directory named example-site in the theme. This directory contains a pre-configured toml file and a ready-made website. I copy the contents of this directory to my home directory. Then I open my config file with an editor and delete the themesDir parameter. Then I can run hugo server and watch my website from localhost port 1313.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve added an image below listing the terminal operations performed. You can check.\nThis way you can create websites to promote products or for a company portfolio. Github Pages There are multiple options for hosting a website built with Hugo. You can see the host and deployment options from the Hosting\u0026amp;Deployment link. We can host our website with services such as github, gitlab, netlify firebase. In the Github option, you can access the page we created via the username.github.io domain. In this application I will work on github.\nWe can publish our portfolio site, one of the websites we have prepared so far, on our own github domain. For this, we go to the directory where our portfolio website is located and create our website with the hugo command in this directory. A public file will be created in the directory and there will be our website using html to be published in this directory. If we submit it to our git repo within this directory we can publish our website using Pages there. We go to the Github page and open a repo named username.github.io.\nWe are connecting the public directory created according to the diagram above to our relevant git repo.\nmyHugoSite $ cd public public/ $ git init public/ $ git remote add origin https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git public/ $ git remote set-url origin http://\u0026lt;public-access-key\u0026gt;@github.com/username/username.github.io After the last changes, to connect to our git repo, you should create a key by following the github-\u0026gt;settings-\u0026gt;developer Settings-\u0026gt;Personal Access Key path and paste this key in the relevant section in the last command to link our repo.\npublic/ $ git add . public/ $ git commit -m \u0026#34;initial commit\u0026#34; public/ $ git push origin main Then we can wait for it to be published from the setting-\u0026gt; Pages section in our repo. Our site will be published from the relevant url. Different architecture for GitHub If we want to publish our website over a subdomain with the same name as the repo, we can open a new repo and send the files in the public to this repo and publish it. If we examine the diagram below, we can create a website in our local system and keep this site on github. We can create a submodule link from another git repo in the \u0026ldquo;themes\u0026rdquo; directory. We can publish our files to be published with Github Pages by sending them to a new repo using the subdomain name to be published. You can create a submodule with\nmySite/ $ git submodule add http://github.com/Yukuro/hugo-theme-shell.git themes/hugo-theme-shell mySite/ $ hugo -d ../myPortfolio We can create html files in a directory called myPortfolio, which is in the same directory as our hugo website using like the command above.Then we can link this directory to the github repo and publish our website on a subdomain with the same name as the repo.\nHugo and Forestry.io Forestry.io is a web service that makes it easy to manage the contents of our website on github using a graphical interface. This service is a CMS tool that works with frameworks such as hugo, jeykll. Content entry in personal blogs can be done easily. You can get more detailed information on the page. It has a simple use. We just have to register for the service and then create a new registration with add site in the \u0026ldquo;My Sites\u0026rdquo; section and select Hugo as the \u0026ldquo;static site generator\u0026rdquo;. And then we connect our repo with the forestry.io service by choosing git provider.\nThen we can prepare our posts in the blog in the document types we choose. Apart from this, there are many CMS applications that work with Hugo. Cloudcannon, strapi.io, netlifyCMS can be given as examples. These are the systems we can use to organize our content between host and deployment.\nThe loop in the diagram represents the CMS service. With CMS services, operations such as content creation and editing can be done before deployment. By connecting with services such as AWS, Netlify, content editing can be done between the git provider and the deploymet service. And at the same time it provides synchronization with the website maintained in git.\n","date":"December 25, 2021","hero":"/images/posts/hugo-githubpages/hugo-githubpages.png","permalink":"https://example.com/posts/hugo-github-page/","summary":"Hello, In this article, I will cover creating simple static websites with hugo, a static website creation tool written in golang, hosting and publishing them on github.

I plan to save the application I prepared and share it in a github repo.\nKNIME KNIME Analytics is a data science environment written in Java. This software allows visual programming in the form of a workflow using various nodes and is an application that allows to develop a data mining application even without knowing advanced coding. It has a very diverse and rich plugin center and is used quite often in academia as well. It is an extensible data science platform where user-created scripts and codes can be used as well as visual programming. KNIME is cross-platform software that supports installation on many operating systems. You can click link to download. In this article, I will review KNIME for GNU/Linux distributions only.\nConfiguration You can extract the tar.gz archive of the KNIME application to the desired location.\n~$ tar xvf knime-analytic-?.?.?.tar.gz -C /opt/knime All libraries and plugins of KNIME are available in the directory. There is a binary file named Knime and you can start the application using it. But it needs java to work.\nJAVA 11 KNIME Analytics works with Java 11 and higher. For this reason, you can install one of the openjdk-11 or openjdk-latest packages for KNIME. Depending on the distribution you use, you can easily download and install these jdks from the main repository.\nFor example, for RHEL based ones;\n~$ sudo dnf/yum install java-11-openjdk # or java-latest-openjdk  Or Debian based ones;\n~$ sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk # or default-jre  Another option I can suggest here is the libertica jdk versions published by Belsoft. These are opensource and freely distributed java jdk versions. You can download and install jdk with many options such as standard and full package. You can find installation scripts or archives [on this page] (https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/#mn) for many operating systems. For KNIME Analytics, standard jdk-11-lts is sufficient. For Linux, we need to download the tar.gz package and extract it to a directory. Then the JAVA_HOME and PATH variables are updated and the java installation is completed.\n~$ mkdir -p ~/libertica-jdks ~$ tar xvf /path/to/downloaded-jdk.tar.gz -C ~/libertica-jdks/ ~$ export JAVA_HOME=~/libertica-jdks/jdk-11.?.? ~$ export PATH=$PATH:JAVA_HOME/bin ## after this ~$ java -version JDK is available in this session. If you want to use it in this location all the time, you should add the lines exported for JAVA_HOME and PATH to your .bashrc or .zshrc file if you are using zsh.\nAfter the Java installation, it is sufficient to go to the directory where knime is installed and run the ./knime script. If you have more than one jdk installed on your system, you can specifically give the path to jdk-11 with ./knime -v /path/to/jdk-11/bin.\nIf you want to create a dektop entry for this;\n[Desktop Entry]Type=ApplicationName=KNIME Analytic PlatformDescription=Data Science EnvironmentExec=/path/to/knime-folder/knime_4.?.?/knimeIcon=/rpath/to/knime-folder/knime_4.?.?/icon.svgCategories=Development;Science;terminal=falseYou can create a file named ~/.local/share/application/knime.desktop and save the entry to the relevant location.If you have problem with exec command. You can give a shell script that runs the ./knime script as a parameter in the exec command. If you are using wayland as a display server, you may have problems in the application. For this reason, you can add the line export GDK_BACKEND=x11 to your configuration file bashrc or zshrc or whatever shell you are using, or inside your script file that starts KNIME. If you\u0026rsquo;re already using x11 you won\u0026rsquo;t have any problems.For example, the shell script that starts KNIME;\n#/bin/bashexport GDK_BACKEND=x11./knime -v /path/to/java-jdk-11/binmay form.\nExtension installations The KNIME application had many extentions. The high number of users and its extensibility are the most important factors that bring it to the top among other data mining applications. You can open the interface by selecting Install KNIME Extensions... from the File menu in the application. You can install it by searching for the add-on you want. For example, you can install the KNIME twitter connector plugin that should be used to connect to the Twitter API and pull data. It will be installed with the necessary dependency packages. The application will need to be restarted before it can read new plugins. Then you can search for the node you want from the Node Repository section and add it to your project. Machine Learning Application with KNIME In this section, a ready-made dataset will be used to prepare a machine learning application. A data mining workflow will be created with KNME nodes by using the dataset named HCV Data Dataset in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The project is created with new project from the File menu. Node Repository I add my file to the project by searching file reader or csv reader from the section. Similarly, I search for the transactions I want to do in the Node Repository and add them to my project and run them, and at the end of each operation, I give the output as the input of the next node.\nWhen I right-click on the nodes, I configure the operation and then run it. When I right-click again, I can see the output of the node as a result of the operation under the menu. The Normalize node below outputs the normalized table and model.\nThe operations performed in this application can be seen as follows. In the application, the data in the csv file was first read with the csv reader node and the categorical values ​​such as sex were given to the category to number node to be converted into numbers. The output of this node is given to the column filter node to extract the Id and categorical gender values. The output dataset is given to the Normalize node. The dataset with 0-1 normalization was given to the Partitioning node to be divided into 70% training and 30% testing. A model was created by giving the training dataset from the parts to the RProp MLP Learner node. This model and test dataset was tested by giving it to the MultiLayerPerceptron Predicter node. And the output of the node has been transformed into a table with the comparison matrix and score values ​​related to the performance in the Scorer node.\nWhen our perceptron model was tested with 1 hidden layer and 10 neurons, it was seen that our comparison matrix and performance values, respectively; It seems to be a very successful model, here the dataset was not raw data. The performance of the data preprocessing on the data set was 98% accuracy. Preprocessing is definitely a important factor for model performance. If you create a model with the raw data set, you can see that you cannot achieve a high success.\nDue to the preprocessing of this dataset;\n reviewed with R Sample dataset review with Smote Outlier cleaning with R boxplot Second time dataset with SMOTE balancing  You can find this project and its dataset in the repo in the link.\nResources and project  github repo HCV data dataset  ","date":"November 10, 2021","hero":"/images/posts/knime/knime.png","permalink":"https://example.com/posts/review-of-data-science-tools/","summary":"Hello, In the first article of the series, where I examined the data science software that I decided to be a series and I will support it with applications, the installation of the KNIME application, which is written in Java and built on Eclipse, and which can prepare data science and artificial intelligence applications with workflow-style visual programming, its configuration on widely used GNU/linux systems. and I will review its usage with a machine learning application.","tags":null,"title":"Review of Data Science Platform Tools -KNIME Analytic(Section 1)"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Hi, today I\u0026rsquo;m gonna teach you how to create a cold-storage wallet for bitcoin or other crypto-coins using usb memory and tails.\nTails, an operating system based on Debian and providing anonymity by routing all network traffic through Tor, will be used as the operating system. We will examine what features are available in some security-oriented distributions. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive the content.\nCold-wallets vs Hot-wallets Cold wallets are a type of wallet that is used to store your private key and other information on hardware that does not have an internet connection. As another type, paper wallets can also be considered as cold wallets. Here, only the private key and the information that will enable us to reach the total balance in the blockchain are available. Examples of hardware wallets are ledger and trazor. These are electronic devices similar to USB sticks that are configured to generate public and private keys and are used to store keys with the highest level of security. It can be ordered and used within a certain fee. On the other hand,hot wallets are the type of wallet where the private key you will use to access your account on the internet is stored in a cloud-based wallet. This one is more insecure than the other but faster. Security in these types of wallets depends on measures taken by the provider of the wallet application, such as two-factor authentication. On the other hand, the security of the provider database also depends on the security measures that the wallet provider can take. This service, offered by many crypto exchanges, makes it easy to use money.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s good to say it again. Cryptocurrency is not a phenomenon that is stored like physical money. The amount transferred from one account to the other account is recorded in the blocks in the data structure, which is in the form of an interconnected list called Blockchain, and is added to the end of the block as a result of the transactions related to the operation of the blockcahin network. In other words, this database does not have an architecture where the amount of money and other information of any account is kept in an object as in banks. For this reason, crypto money cannot be stored in any hardware. The entire blockchain can be downloaded to disk by downloading the bitcoin core for bitcoin. This is the safest method. But as of August 4, 2021, the chain size is 349.3 GB. For this reason, this method is not preferred except bitcoin miners.\nTails Tails is a GNU/Linux distribution with Debian-based security customizations. This system is often used by cybersecurity professionals as a portable and secure operating system. In the crypto world, many people use this method to access and manage their money on the blockchain. You can click the link below to download Tails.\nTails operating system is configured to be more of a portable system. The Internet connection can be routed through the Tor network. At the same time, the system can be \u0026ldquo;persistent\u0026rdquo; so that the files can be saved to the USB memory, and this section is encrypted to provide security. It should be noted that using the Tor network does not provide complete protection and complete invisibility. This is one of the common mistakes made by groups called “Lamer” or “Script Kiddie” in cyber security. Every system running on the Internet may have a security vulnerability. That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s still good to be careful. However, I believe that it can be quite useful as a cold wallet if used carefully.\nInstallation on usb stick After the iso is downloaded, the iso can be written to a usb stick. You can use dd or etcher or any of the rufus software for this. Then the system is started via USB memory. At the first boot, the basic language-keyboard settings are taken and configured and the live system is started in this way. The method I use will be to create a kvm-qemu virtual machine on the host I use, and select and add the USB memory connected to the host machine with the virt-manager visual interface from the hardware list and start it from the boot menu on this device. Installation in a virtual machine is not recommended by tails. You can even detect that tails is running on the virtual machine and you will see a warning message. However, there will be no harm in doing the first installation in this way. The system works on usb but is still a live system.\nMake persistent and encryption For this feature, it can be used by encrypting the part that the system does not fill on the usb memory with the configure persistent volume option from the application menu. This section can be used with this password when you set a password and start the new system, but you can use this section as a live system without opening it.\nCold-wallet configuration Tails comes with electrum bitcoin wallet installed. To use this wallet, the Bitcoin client must be activated from the configuration persistent volume application, so that the configurations and other data of this application can be saved in the persistent partition. A reboot is then required.\nThe necessary configurations can now be made by opening the Electrum wallet.\nElectrum wallet is a very common wallet application. It can be installed on any machine, but in this way it will provide a safer use. First, the wallet must be given a name. Many options are available in the next menu. If you have a standard, 2-factor authentication, multi-signature or previously prepared wallet, you can import it. I will create a standart wallet.\nIn the next option, it is necessary to create a new seed. This is an algorithm that generates the private key. It generates a list of 12 words and this list represents your private key for you. You must record these words in order.\nDo not share these words with anyone In the next step, it asks you to enter these words in order. It then asks you for a password to re-encrypt your wallet.\nYou can see the public key and other information of the wallet from the \u0026ldquo;Wallet information\u0026rdquo; tab.\nNow you can start using… It is necessary to use different wallets for other cryptocurrencies and tokens. For this, you can download and download different wallets and install them on the system.\nOther security orianted GNU/Linux OS Linux Kodachi is also a tails-like system but is a newer distribution. It routes network traffic through VPN and Tor. It can be installed on USB memory or DVD. Likewise, this is a Debian-based distribution.\nWhonix is ​​an operating system with a Debian-based Tor network and a security architecture based on isolation. Whonix consists of two parts: One runs only Tor and acts as a gateway, called the Whonix-Gateway. The other part, called Whonix-Workstation, is on a completely isolated network. Only connections through Tor are possible. It is one of the recommended distributions in the Cubes system. Security is provided by increasing isolation with virtualization on the Xen kernel.\nSome distributions such as Kali, Black Arch and Parrot are distributions where the test tools needed for offensive and defensive security are collected. These come pre-loaded with many tools such as metasploit where known exploits are collected, medusa which is a brute force tool, nmap for network scanning, wireshark and sqlninja.\n","date":"October 8, 2021","hero":"/images/posts/cold-wallet/coldwallet.png","permalink":"https://example.com/posts/cold-wallet-using-usb/","summary":"Hi, today I\u0026rsquo;m gonna teach you how to create a cold-storage wallet for bitcoin or other crypto-coins using usb memory and tails.\nTails, an operating system based on Debian and providing anonymity by routing all network traffic through Tor, will be used as the operating system.
